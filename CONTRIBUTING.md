### 🏦 Adding Bank Support

To add support for a new bank:

1. Create a new parser class in `/app/src/main/java/com/pennywiseai/tracker/data/parser/bank/`
2. Extend the `BankParser` abstract class
3. Implement required methods:
   ```kotlin
   override fun getBankName(): String
   override fun canHandle(sender: String): Boolean
   override fun parse(smsBody: String, sender: String, timestamp: Long): ParsedTransaction?
   ```
4. Add your parser to `BankParserFactory.parsers` list
5. Test with real SMS samples
